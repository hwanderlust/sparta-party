# Notes
* Responsive web design down to 320px (widths) and 1440px+ 
* Layout created with CSS flexbox
* SASS / SCSS for variables, nesting, mixins and imports 
* Used React's context API to share common data among components in different sections of the tree
* Utilized React Transition Group for a carousel of images to change every 5 seconds
* Implemented basic touch-based manual slide of carousel
* Basic custom pagination via spans, CSS and JS
* Made with accessibility in mind allowing keyboard users to conveniently navigate the site
* Used flexbox 'order' attribute to re-order HTML for a nicer design allowing screen-readers the proper context to read headings first prior to other info below it
* **The design is not mine**
* The images, data and text are not mine either
* The menu / hamburger, links and buttons are meant not to work
* Basic build provided by the create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
